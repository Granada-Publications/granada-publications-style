This document serves to explain all the in-house style rules for books and documents created at Granada Publications. Large documents should be split into parts for easy editing and management. It is highly recommended, nay, compulsory for editors to use text-completion software along with a clipboard manager to ease editing tasks.

# General

## Punctuation

If both a question mark and exclamation mark are to be used, the question mark will come first. e.g. What?!

## Language

All publications should use American English unless if the source is in another variant. Consistency of the variant is compulsory.

All text which forms part of worship must be provided in the original language (usually Arabic) with all possible required vowels typed out.

Page numbers in footnotes and elsewhere when abbreviated are 'p.' and 'pp.' for single and multiple page references respectively.

## Font

Only the following fonts may be used for Latin-based text:

1. EB Garamond (http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/)
2. Junicode (http://junicode.sourceforge.net/)
3. Linux Libertine (http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php)
4. Cardo (http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html)

## Dashes

### En Rule

Use an en rule for ranges. Examples [@waddingham2014new]

1. pp. 23--36
2. 1939--45
3. Monday--Sunday
4. 9.30--5.30

## Latin

| Term          | Definition     |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| NB:           |                |
| i.e.          |                |
| e.g.          |                |
| ibid          |                |
| ff            |                |
| lacunae       |                |
| cf            |                |


# Foreign Words

“Isolated non-English words or phrases generally look best italicized rather than placed in quotation marks, especially if they are discussed as set terms rather than quotations from a particular source.” [@waddingham2014new]

If a foreign word has entered the English language, use it in places where its definition in the English language is intended, otherwise use a transliterated version if the original meaning was intended.

Names of places, things, and people which are only available when transliterated, e.g. _Shām_, should *not* be italicized.

Words which have become part of the English language, i.e. can be found in a dictionary, should be used without diacritics or italics. Examples include but may not be limited to: Imam, Ramadan, Quran, and Shariah. This rule however may change depending on the material being published: if it is academic in nature, preserving the diacritics and italics is recommended, however, if the material is for the general masses, then doing away with diacritics and italics is preferable to ensure a smooth reading.

Quran translations and _āyah_ numbering should follow the copy of _Hafs ʿan ʿĀsim_. Thus the first _āyah_ of _Sūrah al-Fātiḥah_ is not the _basmalah_. If names of Quran chapters are used in the main text, they should be in italics. If used to define a reference, italics should be avoided. Examples: (a) Read _Sūrah al-Fātiḥah_, (b) «Praises be to the Lord of all worlds.» (Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1). If the chapters of the Quran are referred to as a noun, then the first _S_ has to be capital, ex: _Sūrahs_ of the Quran.

> According to a more traditional system, periods, commas, colons, and semicolons should appear in the same font as the word, letter, character, or symbol immediately preceding them if different from that of the main or surrounding text. [...] This system, once preferred by Chicago and still preferred by some as more aesthetically pleasing, should be reserved—if it must be used—for publications destined for print only.
> The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition, (§6.2)

## References

Use the § symbol to refer to a section. When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections" (e.g. "§§ 13–21"), much as "pp." (pages) is the plural of "p." It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space, just before the actual section being cited. [@wiki:Section_sign]
