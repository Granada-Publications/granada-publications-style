This document serves to explain all the in-house style rules for books and documents created at Granada Publications. Large documents should be split into parts for easy editing and management. It is highly recommended, nay, compulsory for editors to use text-completion software along with a clipboard manager to ease editing tasks.

# General

## Language

All publications should use American English unless if the source is in another variant. Consistency of the variant is compulsory.

All text which forms part of worship must be provided in the original language (usually Arabic) with all possible required vowels typed out.

Page numbers in footnotes and elsewhere when abbreviated are 'p.' and 'pp.' for single and multiple page references respectively.

## Font

Only the following fonts may be used for Latin-based text:

1. [EB Garamond]
2. [Junicode]
3. [Linux Libertine]
4. [Cardo]

## Foreign Words

“Isolated non-English words or phrases generally look best italicized rather than placed in quotation marks, especially if they are discussed as set terms rather than quotations from a particular source.”[@waddingham2014new]

If a foreign word has entered the English language, use it in places where its definition in the English language is intended, otherwise use a transliterated version if the original meaning was intended. Example: Imam in English refers to someone who leads the prayer whereas Imām refers to a scholar of high caliber.

Names of places, things, and people which are only available when transliterated, e.g. _Shām_, should *not* be italicized.

## Dashes

### En Rule

Use an en rule for ranges. Examples [@waddingham2014new]

1. pp. 23--36
2. 1939--45
3. Monday--Sunday
4. 9.30--5.30

## Latin

+---------+------------+
| Term    | Definition |
+=========+============+
| NB:     |            |
+---------+------------+
| i.e.    |            |
+---------+------------+
| e.g.    |            |
+---------+------------+
| ibid    |            |
+---------+------------+
| ff      |            |
+---------+------------+
| lacunae |            |
+---------+------------+
| cf      |            |
+---------+------------+

## References

Use the § symbol to refer to a section. When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections" (e.g. "§§ 13–21"), much as "pp." (pages) is the plural of "p." It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space, just before the actual section being cited.[@wiki:Section_sign]
