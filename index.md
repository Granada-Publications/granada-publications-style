# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document serves to explain all the in-house style rules for books and
documents created at Granada Publications. Large documents should be split into
parts for easy editing and management. It is highly recommended, nay, compulsory
for editors to use text-completion software along with a clipboard manager to
ease editing tasks.

# General

## Abbreviations

> An abbreviation does not normally have a distinct pronunciation of its own.
> These properties distinguish abbreviations from **acronyms** and
> **initialisms** like *NATO* and *BBC*, from **clipped forms** like *gym* and
> *phone*, and from symbols like * and 5.[@trask2003mind]

> When an organization has a long name, we frequently use a short form of that
> name obtained by taking the initial letters of the important words of the
> name. If the result can be pronounced as a word, we call it an *acronym*.
> Examples of acronyms include *NATO* for the *North Atlantic Treaty
> Organization* and *NASA* for the *National Aeronautics and Space
> Administration*. If the result cannot be pronounced as a word, but must be
> spelled out letter by letter, we call it an *initialism*. Examples include
> *BBC* for the *British Broadcasting Corporation*...[@trask2003mind]

## Dates

Prefer the usage of Hijri dates whenever possible including their corresponding
date in the common era. The abbreviation [AH]{.smallcaps} *(anno Hegirae)*
comes before the year: [AH]{.smallcaps} 1439. Whereas, the abbreviation
[CE]{.smallcaps} appears after the year: 2018 [CE]{.smallcaps}.

## Punctuation

If both a question mark and exclamation mark are to be used, the question mark
will come first. e.g. What?!

variant. Consistency of the variant is compulsory.

(usually Arabic) with all possible required vowels typed out.

Page numbers in footnotes and elsewhere when abbreviated are 'p.' and 'pp.' for
single and multiple page references respectively.

# Foreign Words

“Isolated non-English words or phrases generally look best italicized rather
than placed in quotation marks, especially if they are discussed as set terms
rather than quotations from a particular source.” [@waddingham2014new]

If a foreign word has entered the English language, use it in places where its
definition in the English language is intended, otherwise use a transliterated
version if the original meaning was intended.

Names of places, things, and people which are only available when
transliterated, e.g. _Shām_, should *not* be italicized.

Words which have become part of the English language, i.e. can be found in a
dictionary, should be used without diacritics or italics. Examples include but
may not be limited to: Imam, Ramadan, Quran, and Shariah. This rule however may
change depending on the material being published: if it is academic in nature,
preserving the diacritics and italics is recommended, however, if the material
is for the general masses, then doing away with diacritics and italics is
preferable to ensure a smooth reading.

Quran translations and _āyah_ numbering should follow the copy of _Hafs ʿan
ʿĀsim_. Thus the first _āyah_ of _Sūrah al-Fātiḥah_ is not the _basmalah_. If
names of Quran chapters are used in the main text, they should be in italics. If
used to define a reference, italics should be avoided. Examples: (a) Read _Sūrah
al-Fātiḥah_, (b) «Praises be to the Lord of all worlds.» (Sūrah al-Fātiḥah,
1:1). If the chapters of the Quran are referred to as a noun, then the first _S_
has to be capital, ex: _Sūrahs_ of the Quran.

> According to a more traditional system, periods, commas, colons, and
> semicolons should appear in the same font as the word, letter, character, or
> symbol immediately preceding them if different from that of the main or
> surrounding text. [...] This system, once preferred by Chicago and still
> preferred by some as more aesthetically pleasing, should be reserved—if it
> must be used—for publications destined for print only. The Chicago Manual of
> Style, 16th edition, (§6.2)

## References

Use the § symbol to refer to a section. When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections" (e.g. "§§ 13–21"), much as "pp." (pages) is the plural of "p." It is common practice to follow the section sign with a non-breaking space, just before the actual section being cited. [@wiki:Section_sign]
